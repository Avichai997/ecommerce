# Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the most significant issues in our project we used **Google Drive** and **GitHub** (Git) to collaborate with each other, and integrate easily into our workflow... The synchronization mechanism occurs every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.

# Getting Started

To run the project client + server in development MODE you need to:
- clone the repo.
- install VS Code extension: "Restore Terminals" from link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EthanSK.restore-terminals
- open the file: "Ecommerce.code-workspace". It will open vs code with 2 terminals for server + client, navigate to the folders directory, install npm packages and start the applications. A new window of your default browser will open at "http://localhost:5000/Pages/index.html" - the default start page of the client.
